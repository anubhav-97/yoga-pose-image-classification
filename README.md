# Yoga Pose Image Classification

This project aims to classify yoga poses from images using deep learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify different yoga poses based on input images. This README provides an overview of the project, including the dataset, model architecture, training process, and instructions for running the code.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of labeled images of various yoga poses. It is important to have a diverse and representative dataset that covers a wide range of poses. The dataset should be divided into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

In order to train a deep learning model effectively, a sufficient number of labeled images are required. It is recommended to have at least a few hundred images per class for a reasonably accurate classification.

## Model Architecture

For this project, a deep learning model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is used. CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to capture spatial dependencies in images.

The model architecture typically consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers to extract features from the images. These layers are usually followed by one or more fully connected layers to perform classification.

There are several pre-trained CNN architectures available, such as VGG, ResNet, and Inception, which have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various image classification tasks. You can choose a suitable pre-trained model or design your own architecture based on the requirements of your project.

## Training Process

The training process involves the following steps:

1. **Data preprocessing**: The images need to be preprocessed before feeding them into the model. This may involve resizing, normalization, and data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, flipping, or rotation to increase the variability of the training data.

2. **Model initialization**: Initialize the CNN model, either by creating a new model from scratch or by loading a pre-trained model.

3. **Model configuration**: Configure the model for training by specifying the loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics.

4. **Model training**: Train the model using the training dataset. The training process typically involves feeding batches of images through the model, calculating the loss, and updating the model's parameters using backpropagation.

5. **Model evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model on the testing dataset to measure its performance. Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the model's effectiveness in classifying yoga poses.

6. **Fine-tuning (optional)**: If the initial results are not satisfactory, you can perform fine-tuning by adjusting the hyperparameters, changing the architecture, or using different pre-processing techniques.

## Requirements

To run the code for this project, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- TensorFlow (2.0 or higher)
- Keras (2.3 or higher)
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using `pip` or any other package manager of your choice.

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the code:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.

2. Prepare your dataset by organizing it into separate folders for each class of yoga pose. The folder structure should be as follows:

   ```
   dataset/
   ├── class1/
   │   ├── image1.jpg
   │   ├── image2.jpg
   │   └── ...
   ├── class2/
   │   ├── image1.jpg


   │   ├── image2.jpg
   │   └── ...
   └── ...
   ```

3. Modify the configuration parameters in the code to match your dataset and requirements. This includes setting the paths to the dataset and adjusting hyperparameters.

4. Run the training script to start the training process. Monitor the training progress and adjust hyperparameters as needed.

5. After training, you can evaluate the model's performance using the testing dataset and analyze the results.

6. Optionally, you can save the trained model for future use or deploy it in a production environment.

## Results

The results of the model will vary depending on the dataset, model architecture, and training process. It is recommended to evaluate the model using various metrics to get a comprehensive understanding of its performance.

Some possible evaluation metrics for classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. You can also visualize the performance using confusion matrices or precision-recall curves.

The results obtained from the trained model can be used to classify new images of yoga poses, making it a valuable tool for yoga practitioners, fitness apps, or other related applications.
